        "\n",
        "1. **Agents**: Use language models to choose a sequence of actions dynamically.\n",
        "2. **Chains**: Have a hardcoded sequence of actions.\n",

        "## ➡️ Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "* ### Schema\n",
        "  - **AgentAction**: Represents the action an agent should take (tool and input).\n",
        "  - **AgentFinish**: Represents the final result from an agent.\n",
        "  - **Intermediate Steps**: Previous agent actions and outputs from the current run.\n",
        "\n",
        "* ### Agent\n",
        "  - Decides the next step to take.\n",
        "  - Powered by a language model, prompt, and output parser.\n",
        "  - Inputs: Key-value mapping (required: `intermediate_steps`).\n",
        "  - Outputs: Next action(s) or final response (`AgentAction`, `List[AgentAction]`, or `AgentFinish`).\n",
        "\n",
        "* ### AgentExecutor\n",
        "  - Runtime for an agent.\n",
        "  - Calls the agent, executes actions, and handles various edge cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "* ### Tools\n",
        "  - Functions that an agent can invoke.\n",
        "  - Components:\n",
        "    1. Input schema\n",
        "    2. Function to run\n",
        "\n",
        "* ### Toolkits\n",
        "  - Groups of related tools for common tasks (e.g., GitHub toolkit).\n",

        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## ➡️ Considerations\n",

        "  2. Describe tools effectively for proper agent usage.\n",

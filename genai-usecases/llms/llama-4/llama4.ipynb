            "\n",
            "### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n",
            "- There are three gods: True (always tells the truth), False (always lies), and Random (answers randomly).\n",
            "- The gods respond with \"da\" or \"ja,\" but we don't know which means \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n",
            "- We have three yes-or-no questions to figure out who is who.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 2: Identifying a Strategy\n",
            "A key observation is that if we can find out which god is Random, we can then use two more questions to determine the other two gods, as we can verify the nature of one and then deduce the last one.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 3: First Question\n",
            "For the first question, we should ask a god in such a way that we can get useful information regardless of their nature (True, False, or Random). A strategy could be to ask a god: \"If I were to ask god B if you are Random, would he say 'da'?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Why this question?** \n",
            "  - If you ask the True god, he will truthfully tell you what the False god would say about you being Random. If you are indeed Random, the False god would lie and say you're not Random (so True god would say 'da' if you asked about being Random and got 'da' as an answer from False god). If you are not Random, the False god would truthfully say what you are (but lying about it), so True god would say 'ja'.\n",
            "  - If you ask the False god, he will lie about what the True god would say. So, if you are Random, the True god would truthfully say 'da', but False god lies and says 'ja'. If you are not Random, True god would say 'ja' (truthfully), but False god lies and says 'da'.\n",
            "  - If you ask the Random god, his answer is random.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 4: Analyzing the First Question's Outcome\n",
            "- If the answer is 'da', you can deduce that either the god you asked is Random (because only Random gives random answers), or the scenario fits the pattern where the asked god would say 'da' based on the lying/truth-telling nature of the other gods.\n",
            "- If the answer is 'ja', similarly, you can start deducing based on who you asked.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 5: Second and Third Questions\n",
            "For the second and third questions, you want to ask in such a way that you can directly or indirectly verify the identities.\n",
            "\n",
            "### A Detailed Strategy\n",
            "1. **First Question:** Ask God A, \"If I asked God B if God C is Random, would he say 'da'?\"\n",
            "   - **Outcome Analysis:**\n",
            "     - If God A is True, he truthfully reports what False (B) would say about C.\n",
            "     - If God A is False, he lies about what True (B) would say about C.\n",
            "     - If God A is Random, his answer is random.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Second Question:** Based on the first answer, you need to target a god and ask a question that directly identifies one of them. For example, you could ask God B, \"Are you Random?\" But consider rephrasing questions based on the first outcome.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Third Question:** With information from the first two questions, directly ask or infer the identities.\n",
            "\n",
            "### A Specific Example of Questions\n",
            "Given the complexity and the need for concise resolution:\n",
            "- **Q1:** \"If I were to ask B if C is Random, would he say 'da'?\"\n",
            "- **Q2 & Q3:** Follow-up questions would directly test hypotheses formed, possibly asking one god about another's nature or their own.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's illustrate:\n",
            "- Suppose from Q1, you deduce some information. \n",
            "- For Q2, you might ask God C, \"Is God A the True god?\" \n",
            "- For Q3, based on previous answers, deduce or directly ask.\n",
            "\n",
            "The puzzle requires deducing with minimal questions; hence, directly solving it here shows strategy complexity. Consider logical paths to True, False, and Random in your phrasing.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conclusion\n",
            "By structuring questions to indirectly reveal identities through their responses, we leverage the predictable behavior of True and False gods against the unpredictable nature of the Random god. This puzzle illustrates the power of carefully chosen questions to reveal information under uncertainty. \n",

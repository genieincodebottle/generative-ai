## Graph Database-Powered Q&A Chatbot

This app connects a Neo4j graph database to a Gemini LLM via LangChain to enable natural language Q&A over a **graph schema**. It uses the **default Neo4j Movie database** as its dataset.

### üéûÔ∏è Demo Context

This chatbot uses **Neo4j's built-in Movie Database**, which includes:
- Actors
- Movies
- Directors
- Relationships like `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED`

You can ask natural language questions like:
- "Who acted in The Matrix?"
- "List all movies directed by Christopher Nolan."
- "Which actors have worked together in more than one movie?"
- "Give me movies released after 2000 featuring Keanu Reeves."

Or any other information available in the Movie graph database.

   7. Code Files Overview
      * `utils.py`: Backend logic - connects to Neo4j, loads env variables, runs LangChain-based Q&A logic.
      * `app.py`: Streamlit-based frontend - user inputs questions, displays answers from the graph DB.
   9. Run the App
   
      `streamlit run app.py`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

#### If you see an error like:
```
neo4j.exceptions.ServiceUnavailable: Couldn't connect to localhost:7687 (resolved to ('[::1]:7687', '127.0.0.1:7687')):  
Failed to establish connection to ResolvedIPv6Address(('::1', 7687, 0, 0))
```

#### ‚úÖ Open the Neo4j Desktop dashboard, go to the Settings tab, and verify that the Bolt port (7687) is enabled.

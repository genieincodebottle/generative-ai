## ⚙️ Installation

Get up and running in under 5 minutes:

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/genieincodebottle/generative-ai.git
    cd genai-usecases\agentic-ai
    ```

2. Open the Project in VS Code or any code editor.
3. Create a virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash   
    pip install uv #if uv not installed
    uv venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate # On Linux -> source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Configure Environment
    
    - **Option 1**: 🏠 Local LLM Setup

        1. **Ollama** - Run open models locally with zero API costs:

            - **Windows/MacOS:** Download Ollama models from here -> https://ollama.com/download
            - **Linux:** Install with command:
            
                ```bash
                # Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
                curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
                ```
            - Pull a lightweight models as per your system memory availability 
                ```bash
                ollama pull llama3.2:3b # Options: gpt-oss:20b, llama3.2:1b, llama3.2:3b, llama3.1:8b, deepseek-r1:1.5b, deepseek-r1:7b, deepseek-r1:8b, gemma3:1b, gemma3:4b, gemma3:12b, phi3:3.8b

                # No API keys needed..
                ```
            Reference guide for memory requirement 
            - **llama3.2:1b** (1B parameters) - ~0.7GB RAM
            - **llama3.2:3b** (3B parameters) - ~2GB RAM
            - **llama3.1:8b** (8B parameters) - ~4.5GB RAM
            - **gemma3:1b** (1B parameters) - ~0.7GB RAM
            - **gemma3:4b** (4B parameters) - ~2.5GB RAM

            **Note**: Ollama uses Q4_0 quantization (~0.5-0.7GB per billion parameters)
        2. **Run the following command to list the local open models available in Ollama**

            ```bash
            ollama list
            ```
        3. **Start Ollama Service** (if needed)
            ```bash
            ollama serve  # Only needed if Ollama isn't running automatically
            ```

            **Note**: Most desktop installations start Ollama automatically. Check if it's running by visiting `http://localhost:11434` in your browser or by looking for the Ollama icon in your system tray.

    - **Option 2**: ☁️ Cloud Providers

        - Configure Environment 
            - rename ```.env.example``` to ```.env``` in your project root
            - Update with your keys:

                ```env
                # Choose your preferred providers
                GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key-here
                GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key-here
                ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
                OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
                ```

6. Run any pattern

    ```bash
    streamlit run agentic_workflows\query_routing.py
    streamlit run agentic_workflows\parallel_execution.py
    streamlit run agentic_workflows\prompt_chaining.py

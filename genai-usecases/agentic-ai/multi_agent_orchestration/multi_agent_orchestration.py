        🛡️ Risk Mitigation Strategies (Priority-Ranked):
        1. **Financial Resilience**: Maintain 18-24 months cash runway (elevated from 12 months)
        2. **Market Position**: Build defensible moats through AI/ML differentiation
        3. **Customer Diversification**: Target 100+ customers, no single customer >15% revenue
        4. **Talent Retention**: Implement equity retention programs, competitive compensation
        5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Proactive privacy/AI governance, legal review processes
        6. **Partnership Strategy**: Strategic alliances with larger platforms for market protection
        7. **Technology Hedge**: Invest in proprietary IP, patent portfolio development
        8. **Scenario Planning**: Develop contingency plans for economic downturn scenarios

        📋 Risk Monitoring Framework:
        - Monthly: Market volatility, competitive intelligence, customer health
        - Quarterly: Financial runway, talent turnover, regulatory changes
        - Annually: Strategic risk assessment, insurance coverage review

        🎯 Risk-Adjusted Strategic Recommendations:
        - Prioritize capital efficiency and sustainable growth over rapid scaling
        - Focus on recession-resistant customer segments and use cases
        - Build flexible cost structure with variable components
        - Establish advisory board with industry and regulatory expertise
        - Consider strategic partnerships for risk sharing and market access

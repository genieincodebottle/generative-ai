```tool_code
Thought: I need to gather the information to be verified before I can use the fact_check_tool.  The prompt doesn't provide any information to verify.  I need that information first.
```

Please provide the information you want me to verify.  I need the claims and sources to perform the fact-checking.  Once you provide that, I will use the `fact_check_tool` to analyze the information and provide a fact verification report as requested.

## 🛡️ Llama Prompt Guard 2 (Meta AI)

**Detect Jailbreaks. Block Prompt Injections. Ensure AI Safety.**  
An example Streamlit-based app to test Meta's Llama Prompt Guard 2 models (22M & 86M) via HuggingFace and Groq APIs.

### What is Llama Prompt Guard 2?

LLM-powered applications are increasingly exposed to prompt-based attacks - cleverly crafted inputs that hijack the model's intended behavior. These attacks typically fall into two main categories:

Meta’s **Llama Prompt Guard 2** is a state-of-the-art classifier to detect:
- 🚨 **Prompt Injections:** Inject untrusted user or third-party input into the context, tricking the model into executing unintended instructions.
- ⚠️ **Jailbreak Attempts:** Craft malicious prompts that directly bypass or disable built-in safety and alignment mechanisms of the model.
- 🔐 **Malicious Instructions:** Direct commands or queries that encourage unethical, harmful, or illegal behavior - such as generating fake news, hate speech, phishing content, or instructions for dangerous activities.

It outputs a **maliciousness score** between 0.0 (benign) and 1.0 (dangerous).
